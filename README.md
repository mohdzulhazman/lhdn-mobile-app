## API Integration

The app communicates with the Laravel backend through RESTful APIs:

- **Authentication**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/logout`
- **Expenses**: `/expenses` (CRUD operations)
- **Sales**: `/direct-sales` (CRUD operations)
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard/stats`

## State Management

- **Provider**: Used for authentication state and global app state
- **StatefulWidget**: Used for local component state
- **GoRouter**: For navigation and routing

## UI Components

- `CustomButton`: Styled button with loading states
- `CustomTextField`: Consistent form input fields
- `LoadingOverlay`: Full-screen loading indicator

### Design System
- Material 3 design
- Consistent color scheme
